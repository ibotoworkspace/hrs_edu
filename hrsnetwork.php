                        <h2>COURSE OVERVIEW</h2>
                            <p>Welcome to HRS Academy Network Pro course. This course prepares you for IT support jobs and related IT
                            certifications. You will gain the knowledge and skills you need to install, configure, and maintain a network for a small
                            business.</p>
                            <p>To be successful in this course, you need certain prerequisite skills. We recommend that you complete the TestOut
                            PC Pro or CompTIA A+ certification and have 9 months of networking experience before beginning this course. If you
                            haven’t completed these things, you can still take this course. Just be prepared to have a slightly steeper learning
                            curve than students who have more knowledge and experience to draw from.</p>
                            <p>One of the key things is experience with computer hardware. As we go through this course, we assume that you
                            already know a lot of things. For example, if I were to say in this course we’re going to install a network card in an
                            expansion bus, we assume that you know what we are talking about and how to do that. You know how to select the
                            appropriate network board for the appropriate expansion bus slot and how to configure resources and drivers for
                            that expansion board.</p>
                            <p>Now let’s spend a few minutes talking about what you’re going to learn in this course. We’ll begin with some basics,
                            like how to identify network cable and connector types, identifying the different networking standards common in
                            computer networks today, selecting and installing the appropriate network interface cards for a particular network,
                            and managing static and dynamic IP addressing and network protocols.</p>
                            <p>Then we’ll move into more advanced concepts, like identifying wired and wireless network components and setting
                            up a wired or wireless network. You’ll learn how to configure network security, manage network traffic, and configure
                            remote access to a network. And throughout the course, you’ll learn how to troubleshoot common network issues.</p>
                            <p>So, with that in mind, let’s talk about the certification aspect of this course. It’s very important you understand that
                            certification is critical for a career in the IT industry.</p>
                            <p>The reason certification is so important is that it gives potential employers information they need when making hiring
                            decisions. Basically, having certifications gives you a critical boost during the application and interview process.</p>
                            <p>This course actually meets the specifications of two different industry certification programs. First, TestOut’s
                            Network Pro certification.</p>
                            <p>The TestOut Network Pro certification is an IT certification program, and it is really cool. One of the key values of
                            Network Pro is that it measures not just what you know, but what you can do.</p>
                            <p>In addition to TestOut’s Network Pro exam, this course also prepares you for the CompTIA Network+ certification
                            exam. The Network+ is a vendor-neutral certification. This means it covers mostly generic IT concepts. It is not
                            focused on one particular vendor’s hardware or software.</p>
                            <p>You’ll find that the Network+ certification exam tests you more on what you know and less on what you can do.
                            TestOut’s Network Pro exam fills in the gaps. It expects you to know about computer networking and show what you
                            can do with computer networking.</p>
