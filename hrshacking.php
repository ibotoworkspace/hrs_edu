                        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to the Ethical Hacker Pro course. In this course, we’re going to cover all the
                            information included in the TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro exam and the
                            Certified Ethical Hacker exam.</p>
                        <p>Before we go any further, it’s important that you understand the prerequisites for this
                            course. Although there are no official pre-requisites, we’ve created this course
                            with the expectation that you already know a few things.First, you should know what a
                            network is and how it functions. You should also understand IP
                            addressing, subnetting, DNS, and DHCP, as well as basic security practices.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this course is to allow students and IT professionals to move into the
                            cybersecurity field.To do that, we’ll cover the five phases of ethical hacking.
                            To do that, we’ll cover the five phases of ethical hacking.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We’ll cover reconnaissance, also known as the preparatory phase. This is where the
                                hacker gathers information about a target before launching an attack. This task is
                                completed in phases prior to exploiting system vulnerabilities.</li>
                            <li>We’ll discuss scanning. In the scanning phase, the hacker identifies a quick way to gain
                                access to the network and look for information.</li>
                            <li>Next is the gaining access phase. Hackers gain access to the system, applications, and
                                network, and escalates their user privileges to take control of systems.</li>
                            <li>After that, we’ll look at how to maintain access. This is where the hacker keep
                                accessing the organization’s systems to launch additional attacks on the network.</li>
                            <li>Then we’ll discuss how to cover your tracks. After the hacker gains access, they cover
                                their tracks to avoid being detected by security personnel.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>HRS Academy learning management system provides several features designed to help you learn
                            and retain ethical hacking skills. Each section provides you with videos and
                            demonstrations that teach you how to perform necessary tasks. Text lessons help reinforce
                            the concepts taught in the videos, and interactive hands-on labs let you practice
                            the skills you’ve learned. Within each section, you’ll find practice questions to test your
                            knowledge.</p>
                        <p>LabSim provides several features designed to help you learn and retain ethical hacking
                            skills. Each section provides you with videos and demonstrations that teach you how to
                            perform necessary tasks. Text lessons help reinforce the concepts
                            taught in the videos, and interactive hands-on labs let you practice the skills you’ve
                            learned. Within each section, you’ll find practice questions to test your knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Now, let’s talk about your certification because that’s really the goal of this course: to
                            provide you with the information you need to become an industry-certified ethical hacker.
                            Certification is important in two ways if you plan to have a career in the cybersecurity
                            industry. First, it gives employers critical information they need to make
                            hiring decisions. Second, it gives you an edge in the job application process because
                            employers look for certifications.
                            This course meets the specifications for two different industry certification programs, the
                            TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro
                            certification and the EC-Council Certified Ethical Hacker.</p>
                        <p>The TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro certification measures how much you know and what you can do.
                            The Ethical Hacker Pro certification validates that you have the equivalent knowledge of a
                            two years of work experience in the cybersecurity
                            field or training leading up to this course.</p>
                        <p>TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro focuses on the basics of penetration testing and ethical hacking.
                            It also helps the student be aware of network attack strategies and common countermeasures.
                            It prepares students to use various testing tools
                            to analyze networks for vulnerabilities. Knowledge of these vulnerabilities also helps
                            students understand how to counter these vulnerabilities and improve network security.</p>
                        <p>In addition, The TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro cert takes things a step further by emphasizing
                            real-world job skills. To get your Ethical Hacker Pro certification, you won’t answer a
                            bunch of multiple-choice questions; you’ll perform
                            real-world tasks in a simulated environment.</p>
                        <p>The Certified Ethical Hacker, or CEH, is a qualification obtained from EC-Council. EC-Council
                            states that a certified ethical hacker is a skilled professional who understands and knows
                            how to look for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in
                            target systems and uses the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful
                            and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target systems.</p>
                        <p>This knowledge is assessed by answering multiple-choice questions regarding various ethical
                            hacking techniques and tools. The code for the current CEH exam is 312-50. To take the exam,
                            a candidate must have two years of work experience
                            in the information security domain and pay a $100 fee with their application.</p>
                        <p>So, as you can see, the CEH exam works hand-in-hand with the TestOut Ethical Hacker Pro
                            certification. The CEH exam uses multiple-choice questions to assess knowledge, and TestOut
                            Ethical Hacker Pro uses simulations to test what you can do.</p>
                        <p>With this introduction in mind, it’s time to start learning about ethical hacking.</p>
