                        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
                        <p>Server Pro 2016 (Networking course): This course prepares you for IT support jobs and related
                            IT certifications. You will gain
                            the knowledge and skills you need to install, configure, and maintain the networking
                            features of Microsoft’s Windows Server 2016 operating system.</p>
                        <p>To be successful in this course, you need certain prerequisite skills and base knowledge.</p>
                        <p>First, we recommend that you complete the TestOut Server Pro 2016: Install and Storage course
                            or pass the comparable Microsoft exam and have 9 months of Windows Server experience before
                            you begin this course. If you don’t have these qualifications,
                            you can still take this course. Just be prepared to have a slightly steeper learning curve
                            than students who have more knowledge and experience to draw from.</p>
                        <p>One of the key preparations for this course is experience with the Windows Server 2016
                            operating system. We’re going to assume that you already know a lot about it. For example,
                            if we were to say we’re going to use Server Manager to install a new
                            role or feature, we’re going to assume you know what we’re talking about and how to do that.
                        </p>
                        <p>We’ll also assume that you understand how Microsoft Hyper-V works and how to access virtual
                            machines. But don’t worry too much about this. It’s an easy skill to pick up, and we’ll
                            cover the basics so that you can work with the virtual machines in
                            our lab simulations.</p>
                        <p>So, with that in mind, let’s talk about the certification aspect of this course. It’s very
                            important you understand that
                            certification is critical for a career in the IT industry.</p>
                        <p>Certification is so important because it gives potential employers information they need when
                            making hiring decisions. Basically,
                            having certifications gives you a critical boost during the application and interview
                            process.</p>
                        <p>This course meets the specifications of two different industry certification programs. First,
                            TestOut’s Server Pro 2016: Networking certification ,which is part of TestOut’s IT
                            certification program. One of the key values of Server Pro certification
                            is that it measures not just what you know, but what you can do.</p>
                        <p>In addition to TestOut’s Server Pro 2016: Networking exam, this course also prepares you for
                            the Microsoft Exam 70-741: Networking with Windows Server 2016</p>
