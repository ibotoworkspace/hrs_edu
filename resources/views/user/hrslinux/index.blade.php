                        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
                        <p>This course prepares you to enter an IT career involving Linux. You will gain the knowledge and skills you need to install, configure, operate, and 
                        troubleshoot the Linux operating system. It also prepares you for Linux-related IT certifications, such as the CompTIA Linux+ exam..
                        </p>
                        <p>To be successful in this course, you need certain prerequisite skills and base knowledge.</p>
                        <p>We recommend that you have a solid understanding of computer systems, including computer hardware and general operating system concepts. You also need a basic 
                        understanding of networks and how computers communicate within a local network and over the internet. If you don’t have this knowledge, you may wish to complete 
                        the HRS PC Pro course and the HRS Network Pro course. Additionally, 9 to 12 months experience in an IT-related job will be helpful. If you don’t have this knowledge 
                        and experience, you can still take this course. Just be prepared to have a slightly steeper learning curve.
                        </p>
                        <p>This course meets the specifications of two different industry certification programs. First, TestOut’s Linux Pro certification exam, which is part of TestOut’s 
                        IT certification program. One of the key values of Linux Pro certification is that it measures not just what you know, but what you can do.
                        </p>
                        <p>In addition to TestOut’s Linux Pro exam, this course also prepares you for the CompTIA Linux+ certification exam.</p>
